# AlMundoFrontendTestV2

It's a MEAN stack project, by the way following dependecies needs to be installed/enable or reference itself:

MongoDB 3.6
Express 4
Node 8.9.4

Angular is setted as CDN dependecie.

Firstable, i imported the data.json provieded by into a mongodb schema/collection, just for have a data persistance layout, that's the first to run the project, is needed to run mongodb, after that, run:

1. Copy data.json into mondogb installation bin folder. My case is 'C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.6\bin'.
2. In cmd, goes to directory of first step and then, execute -> mongoimport.exe --db hotels --collection hotels --file data.json.
3. Check the import. When mongodb is installed, there is an option that allows to install MongoDB Compass Comunity, it's GUI to take a look of databases and collections.

After download the project and enable dependecies, is necessary in cmd goes to project folder, once inside AlMundoFrontendTestV2 folder, start the project -> node app.js

Note: For test issue, the API and web site are in same server.

For test the website, the server is listening on 80 port, by the way, to access to website the url is http://localhost

Exercise 1:

Into AlMundoFrontendTestV2, there is a folder named api, within model, controller and route. There are different folders to respect a modularity pattern.

The model has the structure and mondodb schema, needed for mongoose to connect NodeJS to MondoDB.

The controller have all API REST methods, the basic methods were implemented, GET, PUT, POST and DELETE (CRUD). I created a couple methods aditional to cover AlMundo Tests, for example the search filter by name (or part of name) and search filtered by number of hotel stars.

The route have the uri's to consult all API methods:

	app.get('/api/hotels', hotel_controller.getAllHotels); // Lista todos los hoteles
	app.get('/api/hotels/names', hotel_controller.getHotelNames); // lista todos los nombres de los hoteles
	app.get('/api/hotels/:id', hotel_controller.getHotelById); // Listo un hotel por ID

	app.get('/api/hotels/stars/5', hotel_controller.getHotel5Stars); // Lista los hoteles 5 estrellas
	app.get('/api/hotels/stars/4', hotel_controller.getHotel4Stars); // Lista los hoteles 4 estrellas
	app.get('/api/hotels/stars/3', hotel_controller.getHotel3Stars); // Lista los hoteles 3 estrellas
	app.get('/api/hotels/stars/2', hotel_controller.getHotel2Stars); // Lista los hoteles 2 estrellas
	app.get('/api/hotels/stars/1', hotel_controller.getHotel1Stars); // Lista los hoteles 1 estrellas

	app.get('/api/hotel', hotel_controller.getNamesByFilter); // Lista los hoteles por filtro


	app.post('/api/hotels', hotel_controller.addHotel); // AÃ±ade un hotel
	app.put('/api/hotels/:id', hotel_controller.updateHotel); // Actualiza un hotel
	app.delete('/api/hotels/:id', hotel_controller.deleteHotel); // Borra un hotel
  
  
Exercise 2:

After open the page http://localhost, all the hotels appears into list similar to image provieded in test resources, with photo, name, stars, main features (amenities) and price per night.

The filter search area (left panel), there are two small blue triangules, if you click each one, the filter is hidden or shown.

Name filtered search, works ignore case, that's mean if the user type 'Hotel' is the same as 'hotel'. Also, after typing any work or letter, the user can press enter or make click in 'Aceptar' button.
